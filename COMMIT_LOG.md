# 🔐 Implement User Registration Approval Workflow

## Summary
Added comprehensive user registration approval system for Regional Directorate of Education of Western Greece (ΠΔΕΔΕ) Online Leave Management System. Users can now register but require approval from leave handlers (χειριστής των αδειών) before accessing the system.

## 🎯 Key Features Added

### User Registration Control
- **Pending Registration Status**: New users default to `PENDING` status with `inactive` state
- **Access Control**: Users cannot access system until approved by authorized personnel
- **Superuser Bypass**: Superusers automatically bypass approval workflow
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Track who approved/rejected registrations with timestamps and notes

### Enhanced User Model (`accounts/models.py`)
```python
# New fields added to User model:
- registration_status: CharField with PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED choices
- registration_date: DateTimeField with auto_now_add
- approved_by: Self-referential ForeignKey to track approver
- approval_date: DateTimeField for approval timestamp
- approval_notes: TextField for approval/rejection reasons
```

### Business Logic Methods
- `approve_registration(approver, notes=None)`: Approve user and activate account
- `reject_registration(approver, notes=None)`: Reject user and keep account inactive
- `can_access_system()`: Control system access based on approval status
- Property methods: `is_pending_approval`, `is_approved`, `is_rejected`

### Enhanced Admin Interface (`accounts/admin.py`)
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Color-coded status display (🟡 Pending, ✅ Approved, ❌ Rejected)
- **Bulk Actions**: Approve/reject multiple users simultaneously
- **Enhanced Fieldsets**: Registration approval section with readonly audit fields
- **Improved List Display**: Registration status column with visual indicators

### Modified UserManager (`accounts/models.py`)
- **create_user()**: Sets new users to PENDING status and inactive state
- **create_superuser()**: Automatically sets APPROVED status and active state
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

## 📊 Database Changes

### Migration: `accounts/migrations/0008_add_registration_approval_workflow.py`
```sql
-- New fields added to accounts_user table:
ALTER TABLE accounts_user ADD COLUMN registration_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING';
ALTER TABLE accounts_user ADD COLUMN registration_date DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE accounts_user ADD COLUMN approved_by_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE accounts_user ADD COLUMN approval_date DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE accounts_user ADD COLUMN approval_notes TEXT;

-- Foreign key constraint for approved_by field
ALTER TABLE accounts_user ADD CONSTRAINT accounts_user_approved_by_fk 
    FOREIGN KEY (approved_by_id) REFERENCES accounts_user(id);
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### User Workflow States
1. **PENDING** (Default): User registered but cannot access system
2. **APPROVED**: User approved by leave handler, can access system
3. **REJECTED**: User rejected by leave handler, cannot access system

### Admin Interface Enhancements
- Custom list display with colored status indicators
- Bulk approval/rejection actions for efficient management
- Readonly fields for audit trail (registration_date, approval_date, approved_by)
- Enhanced search and filtering capabilities

### Security Considerations
- Only users with appropriate permissions can approve/reject registrations
- Complete audit trail for compliance and accountability
- Inactive users cannot authenticate or access system resources
- Superusers maintain administrative access without approval requirements

## 🧪 Testing Completed

### Functional Testing
- ✅ New user registration creates PENDING status
- ✅ PENDING users cannot access system
- ✅ Approval process activates user account
- ✅ Rejection process keeps user inactive
- ✅ Superuser creation bypasses approval workflow
- ✅ Admin interface displays correct status indicators
- ✅ Bulk actions work correctly for multiple users

### Database Testing
- ✅ Migration applies successfully to existing data
- ✅ Foreign key relationships work correctly
- ✅ Default values properly set for existing users
- ✅ Audit trail fields populate correctly

## 📋 Affected Files

### Modified Files
- `accounts/models.py` - Enhanced User model with approval workflow
- `accounts/admin.py` - Enhanced admin interface with approval features

### New Files
- `accounts/migrations/0008_add_registration_approval_workflow.py` - Database migration

## 🎯 Business Impact

### Improved Security
- Prevents unauthorized system access
- Ensures only vetted personnel can use the system
- Maintains compliance with institutional policies

### Enhanced Administration
- Streamlined user approval process
- Complete audit trail for administrative actions
- Visual feedback for pending registrations

### User Experience
- Clear registration process with status feedback
- Transparent approval workflow
- Immediate access for approved superusers

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration Required**: Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply schema changes
2. **Existing Users**: All existing users will have `registration_date` set to migration time
3. **Admin Access**: Superusers maintain full access without approval requirements
4. **Production Considerations**: Test approval workflow thoroughly before deployment
